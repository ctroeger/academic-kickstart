## What Have We Learned about a Successful Pandemic Response?  
While the World Health Organization (WHO) and Global Health Security Agenda have developed useful frameworks for assessing epidemic and pandemic preparedness and response, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that a perfect model does not exist. Through the Exemplars work, we aim to derive lessons learned about the components of successful epidemic preparedness and response and to develop a conceptual model that integrates these components.  

## Why Has COVID-19 Hit Some Countries Harder Than Others?  
This is a challenging question to which there is no single answer. Studies on the factors that contribute to a country’s ability to successfully control COVID-19 and mitigate its effects are ongoing. Researchers at Exemplars in Global Health and elsewhere are exploring some hypotheses:

* Countries with a greater ability to control or close their borders, such as island nations and small countries, can better prevent introduction of the virus or limit its spread.  
* Countries with high levels of social cohesion and trust in government and the health system are better equipped to enact a swift and effective policy response.  
* Health systems with centralized decision-making authority and those whose political leaders prioritized data-based decision making and emphasized the importance of public health communications are better equipped to enact a swift and effective policy response.  
* Governments that provide strong social safety nets and/or programs targeted at supporting vulnerable populations can reduce the overall health and economic impacts of a pandemic.  

Other context-specific factors that contribute to a country’s ability to control the virus and mitigate its effects include the age structure of the population, experience with recent epidemics or pandemics, obesity rates, and the effectiveness of disease-detection platforms.
