## Maintenance of Essential Health Services

The COVID-19 pandemic and non-pharmaceutical policies to restrict movement to limit its spread has decreased both the supply of and demand for essential health
services like maternal and child health, outpatient visits, childhood vaccinations, and diagnostic screenings for non-communicable diseases.

The Exemplars in COVID-19 Response project worked with researchers in four low- and lower-middle income countries in sub-Saharan Africa to identify 
strategies and actions that have helped to maintain the continuity of these essential health services. Please visit the [Exemplars in Global Health](https://www.exemplars.health/) website to 
learn about this project and other ways that countries have excelled in global health!
