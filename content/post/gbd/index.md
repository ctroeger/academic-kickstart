## [Global Burden of Disease Study](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/)

The Global Burden of Disease Study is a systematic, scientific effort to quantify the sources of health loss globally including
diseases, injuries, and risk factors. Everyone deserves to live a long life in full health and the GBD helps to create a 
comprehensive understanding of disease burden across countries, time, age, and sex. 

The GBD is updated regularly. For three and a half iterations of the study (2015, 2016, 2017, 2019), I was a research scientist
responsible for statistical modeling of the burden of diarrheal diseases and lower respiratory infections. These are two of the 
leading causes of preventable deaths worldwide, especially among children younger than 5 years. My hope is that the evidence
generated from the GBD may help to target interventions and actions to help reduce under 5 mortality and give all children
a chance to develop to their full potential.
